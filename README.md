Usage
-----

Azure node. Can be used to work with Azure DocumentDB using 3 nodes:

 - Supports :
 
â—¦CRUD Database and Collections

Still finishing Documents Node


##Database Node
Use `msg.payload` to create, delete and list the Database name.

Ex: 'msg.payload' -> {"dbname": "databaseName", "action": "C"};

*put "C" to crete a Database
        - If you create a new database, the node will send as output the name of Database.
*put "L" to list Database
*put "D" to delete a Database


##Collections Node
Use `msg.payload` to create, delete and list the Collection name.

Ex: 'msg.payload' -> {"dbname": "databaseName", "collName": "colletionName", "action": "C"};

*put "C" to crete a Collection
*put "L" to list Collection
*put "D" to delete a Collection

##Documents Node
Use `msg.payload` to work with documents in DocumentDB

Ex: 'msg.payload' -> {"dbname": "databaseName", "collName": "colletionName", "action": "C", "doc": "*"};

*** Trying to figure out if is better to send a doc as JSON, local file or address...

*put "C" to crete a Document
*put "L" to list Documents
*put "D" to delete a Document
*put "R" to read a Document
*put "Q" to query a document
